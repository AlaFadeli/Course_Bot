# 📚 ENP CourseBot

A Telegram bot developed to help students at the École Nationale Polytechnique (ENP) quickly access and manage shared academic materials — like TDs, TPs, courses, and CCs — using intuitive commands and search functionality.

> 🧠 *This project was born from a random idea and built to support fellow students with quick, organized access to resources.*
